<p>Rossi</p>
<p>Named after the historic Ferdinando Rossi from Milan, one of the most important wholesalers of tobacco-related goods at the time and one of the first to found Fabbrica di Pipe di Radica Rossi in 1886. Initiating the production of briar pipes in Italy soon became one of the industry's most famous and important pipe makers. 
Rossi's original ideas and masterful pipes, and his attention to even the most minor of details, are still going strong in each of Rossi's magnificent tobacco pipes. </p>

<p>Savinelli</p>
<p>In 1876 in Milan, Italy, Achille Savinelli opened one of the first shops exclusively focused on tobacco and smoking accessories. At that time, it was a groundbreaking move as the Italian Government held a tobacco monopoly. Achille was convinced briar pipes represented the future of pipe smoking and heavily influenced Ferdinando Rossi as his commitment to premium craftsmanship in briar pipes changed the industry's entire face away from clay meerschaum.
